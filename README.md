# CoverallsMulti

CoverallsMulti is a Coveralls client with support for multi-language repos. Specify the paths to your coverage output files in `.coveralls.yml`, and CoverallsMulti will handle formatting them, merging them into one big superfile, and posting the result to Coveralls.io.

### Currently supported:

#### CI Providers
- TravisCI

#### Languages/Output Formats
- Ruby (SimpleCov)
- JavaScript (lcov)

#### Coming Soon
- Elixir

## Installation

Add this line to the test group in your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'coveralls-multi'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install coveralls-multi

## Usage

Set up coverage measurement for each of the languages in your repo (TODO: add links to setup instructions for supported languages).

Once you know where the output files will go, add the output type and path to `.coveralls.yml`. Example:

```
service_name: travis-ci
repo_token: [REPO_TOKEN]
multi:
  simplecov: coverage/.resultset.json
  lcov: coverage/lcov.info
```

Then run `coveralls-multi` to merge the output files and send them to Coveralls. In a CI environment, run `coveralls-multi` after you run your test commands.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
