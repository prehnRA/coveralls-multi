# CoverallsMulti

CoverallsMulti is a Coveralls client with support for multi-language repos. Specify the paths to your coverage output files in `.coveralls.yml`, and CoverallsMulti will handle formatting them, merging them into one big superfile, and posting the result to Coveralls.io.

### Currently supported:

#### Languages & Output Formats

| *Language* | *Coverage tool* | *Config key* |
|----------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Elixir | [ExCoveralls](https://github.com/parroty/excoveralls) (JSON output) | `excoveralls` |
| JavaScript | [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc), or any tool that can output an lcov file | `lcov` |
| Ruby | [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) | `simplecov` |

#### CI Providers

- TravisCI

#### Coming Soon

Have another language, tool, or CI provider you'd like to see supported? [Let me know](https://github.com/radditude/coveralls-multi/issues/new).

## Installation

Add this line to the test group in your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'coveralls-multi'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install coveralls-multi

## Usage

1. Set up coverage measurement for each of the languages in your repo.

2. Once you know where the output files will go, set up your `.coveralls.yml` with the appropriate keys and paths like so (see supported languages above for more details on the supported config keys):

```
service_name: travis-ci
repo_token: [REPO_TOKEN]
multi:
  simplecov: coverage/.resultset.json
  lcov: coverage/lcov.info
  excoveralls: cover/excoveralls.json
```

3. Run `coveralls-multi` to merge the output files and send them to Coveralls. In a CI environment, set up `coveralls-multi` as an final step after you run your test commands.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

TODO: add better contributing instructions (especially for adding a new formatter)
